## What it does
This project is aimed to create a calculator that can be used from the command line with several different options that will be defined as the releases come out.

## Why this project is useful

It really isn't. There are much better calculators out there. I don't reccommend using this. This is only being done as a homework assignment.

This project isn't meant to be collaborative. Trying to get started on this project is futile.
